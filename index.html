      <ul class="reps">
        <li>A Transfer on Death ("TOD") designation transfers ownership of Shares to the registered owner's designated

        necessary or appropriate, including in the case of a minor transferee, documentation of a custodian.</li>
        <li>Until the death of the registered owner(s), the TOD beneficiary(ies) has (have) no present interest in, right to, or authority over, the TOD account.</li>
        <li>A TOD designation will be accepted only where Shares are owned by a natural person and registered in that 
        individual's name or by two or more natural persons as joint tenants with rights of survivorship.</li>
        <li>Accounts registered to trusts, corporations, charities, and other such legal entities may not declare a TOD 
        designation. These legal entities, however, may be listed as a beneficiary on a TOD for accounts registered to a natural person.</li>
        <li>A TOD designation made by joint tenants with rights of survivorship does not take effect until the last of all multiple registered owners dies.</li>
        <li>If the beneficiary(ies) does (do) not survive the registered owner(s), the Shares will be treated as belonging to the deceased registered owner's estate.</li>
        <li>The TOD beneficiaries must be names on this form; “spouse” or “children” is NOT an acceptable designation. 
        Minors may not be named as a beneficiary unless a custodian or guardian for such minor is also named.</li>
        <li>A TOD designation may be voided at any time by the Fund in its sole discretion, if there is any doubt as to the 
        validity or effectiveness of a TOD designation.</li>
        <li>Upon the death of any of the joint tenants, the surviving registered owner(s) may revoke or change the TOD
        designation at any time. A TOD direction is revocable prior to death of registered owner(s) by (a) the sale of the
        registered owner's (or registered owners') Shares, (b) assigning Shares to another person or entity, (c) filing a 
        revocation of TOD registration or filing a change in TOD registration with a new beneficiary (or beneficiaries). A 
        TOD direction may not be revoked by a provision in a will or any other instrument.</li>
        <li>The Fund will only honor a TOD direction that it has recorded in its registration records. TOD directions, changes 
        and revocations will only be accepted when in proper form. Proper form requires: (a) endorsement by the registered 
        owner(s); (b) instruction indicating either a new form of registration, removal of the current TOD beneficiaries 
        and/or designation of a new TOD beneficiaries; and (c) actual receipt by the Fund prior to the registered owner's death.</li>
        <li>This agreement is between the registered owner(s) and the Fund. You should discuss this TOD direction with your 
        attorney to ensure that it is consistent with your estate and tax planning and is enforceable under the laws of your state.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I (we) authorize the Fund to register all of my (our) Shares in beneficiary form, assigning ownership on my (our) death to 
        my (our) beneficiary(ies). I understand that if more than one beneficiary is listed, percentages for each must be designated. 
        If percentages are not designated, the Shares will be divided equally. Percentages must equal 100%. For additional 
        beneficiaries, please complete and attach an additional form.</p>

      <legend>9. SUBSCRIBER’S REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS</legend>
      <p>I, the undersigned, hereby subscribes to purchase Shares in the amount set forth on the Signature Page of this Subscription 
      Agreement and under the terms and conditions contained herein and in the Memorandum. Capitalized terms used but not 
      defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Memorandum.</p>
      <p><strong>The undersigned hereby makes the following representations and warranties.</strong></p>

      <ul class="reps">
        <li>I have received read and fully understand the Memorandum.</li>
        <li>I am basing my decision to invest only on the information in the Memorandum and information requested of the
        Fund in writing by me, and I have not relied on any other representation made by any other person.</li>
        <li>I am a citizen and/or a legal permanent resident of the United States of America, with my principal residence
        maintained at the address set forth in this Subscription Agreement, and I am at least twenty-one years of age.</li>
        <li>I am executing this Subscription Agreement: (A) on my own behalf, as a natural person, and I have the legal capacity
        to execute, deliver and perform my obligations under this Subscription Agreement or (B) on behalf of a corporation,
        partnership, limited liability company, trust or other entity, and (i) such entity is duly organized, validly existing
        and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction where it was formed and is authorized by its governing
        documents to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Subscription Agreement and to become a
        Shareholder of the Fund, (ii) I have the full power and authority to execute and deliver this Subscription Agreement
        on behalf such entity and (iii) this Subscription Agreement, and such entity’s execution hereof and performance of
        its obligations hereunder, has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate or other action by the entity.</li>
        <li>I am not, and, in the case of a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust or other entity, none of its
        principal owners, partners, members, directors or officers are, included on the Office of Foreign Assets Control list
        of foreign nations, organizations and individuals subject to economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign
        policy and national security goals, Executive Order 13224, which sets forth a list of individuals and groups with
        whom U.S. persons are prohibited from doing business because such persons have been identified as terrorists or
        persons who support terrorism, or any other watch list issued by any governmental authority, including the
        Securities and Exchange Commission.</li>
        <li>I consent and understand that by owning Shares I will be deemed to have consented, to disclosure by the Fund, the
        Manager, the sponsor of the Fund, and their respective agents and affiliates to relevant third parties of information
        pertaining to my “accredited investor” status and any other information requests related thereto or otherwise
        appropriate to establish the Fund’s entitlement to a private offering exemption under the Securities Act. In addition,
        I understand that the Fund and its respective agents and affiliates will disclose any and all information required or
        requested by governmental or other authorities as required by or in connection with the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, as
        amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, and other antimony laundering, anti-terrorism and similar laws, rules and
        regulations including, without limitation, Executive Order 13224.</li>
        <li>The funds I am investing in the Fund are not derived from any criminal enterprise.</li>
        <li>I agree that I will provide additional information or take such other actions as may be necessary or advisable for the
        Fund for anti-money laundering purposes. The Fund may provide this information, or report the failure to comply
        with such requests, to appropriate governmental authorities, in certain circumstances without notifying me that the
        information has been provided. In the event of my delay or failure to produce any such requested information, the
        Fund may refuse to accept my investment. The Fund reserves the right to require any payment or distribution to a
        Shareholder to be paid into the account from which the Shareholder’s subscription funds originated.</li>
        <li>I understand that an investment in the Fund involves substantial risk, and I am fully aware of and understand all of
        the risk factors relating to the investment, including, but not limited to, the risks set forth in the “RISK FACTORS”
        section of the Memorandum.</li>
        <li>My overall commitment to investments that are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to my individual net
        worth. My investment in the Fund will not cause my overall commitment to illiquid investments to become
        excessive. I have adequate means of providing for my financial requirements, both current and anticipated, and
        have no need for liquidity in this investment. I can bear and am willing to accept the economic risk of losing my
        entire investment in the Fund.</li>
        <li>I am purchasing the Shares for my own account and for investment purposes only, and not for the account of others.
        I have no present intention, contract, agreement, undertaking or arrangement to assign, resell or subdivide the Shares.</li>
        <li>I acknowledge that the Fund is relying upon the truth and accuracy of my representations, warranties, statements,
        covenants, and agreements set forth herein in order to determine my suitability to invest in the Fund.</li>
        <li>All information that I have provided in this Subscription Agreement is complete, accurate and correct as of its date
        and may be relied on by the Fund in connection with my investment. I hereby agree to notify the Fund immediately
        of any material change in any of that information occurring before the acceptance of this Subscription Agreement.</li>
        <li>I have provided my correct Taxpayer Identification Number in the attached Form W-9, and I am not subject to back-
        up withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends (or the Internal Revenue Service has notified
        me that I am no longer subject to back-up withholding).</li>
        <li>I have had the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from, the Fund and the Manager, and their
        respective principals, concerning the Fund, the Manager and their respective affiliates, the Shares and the terms and
        conditions of the Offering, and to obtain any additional information deemed necessary to verify the accuracy of the
        information contained in the Memorandum, to the extent possessed by the Fund or obtainable by it without
        unreasonable effort or expense. I have been provided with all materials and information requested by either me or
        others representing me, including any information requested to verify any information furnished to me.</li>
        <li>I understand that, due to the restrictions described below, and the lack of any public market existing or likely to
        exist in the future for the Shares, my investment in the Shares will be illiquid and that I will be required to bear the
        financial risks of the investment for an indefinite period of time.</li>
        <li>I understand that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act or any securities laws of any state or
        other jurisdiction, and that the Shares are being offered and sold in reliance on specific exemptions from the
        registration requirements of applicable federal and state securities laws. I understand that the sale, assignment,
        transfer, or other disposition of the Shares is restricted under applicable federal and state securities laws and the
        terms of the Charter. I understand that the Fund has no obligation and does not intend to register any of the Shares
        for resale under any federal or state securities laws or to take any action under any such laws to make available an
        exemption from registration requirements. I further agree that I will not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose
        of any Shares I purchase, in whole or in part, unless such sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition is (A)
        registered under applicable federal and state securities law or sold in reliance upon an exemption from such
        registration, and (B) otherwise permitted by and made in accordance with the terms of the Charter. I also understand
        and acknowledge that, if the Shares are certificated, one or more legends will be placed on all certificates evidencing
        the Shares with respect to restrictions on any sale, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of the Shares imposed
        by applicable federal and state securities laws and the Charter.</li>
        <li>I understand that no state or federal governmental authority has approved or disapproved of the Shares, reviewed
        or passed on the accuracy or adequacy of the Memorandum or made any finding or determination relating to the
        fairness of an investment in the Fund and that no state or federal governmental authority has recommended or
        endorsed or will recommend or endorse the Shares.</li>
        <li>If subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), I am aware of, and have taken into
        consideration, the diversification requirements of Section 404(a)(3) of ERISA in determining to invest in the Fund
        and have concluded that such investment is prudent and not a non-eempt “prohibited transaction” within the
        meaning of Section 40 of ERISA and Section 4975(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 19 (the “Code”).</li>
        <li>If acting on behalf of a charitable remainder trust, I am aware that if any portion of the income derived from the
        trust’s ownership of Shares is deemed to be unrelated business taable income (“UBTI”), Section 4(c) of the
        Code imposed on the trust an excise tax equal to the amount of such UBTI.</li>
        <li>I understand and agree that I may not assign this offer or, except as specifically permitted by law, revoke my
        subscription. I acknowledge that the Fund has the unconditional right to accept or reject this subscription, in whole or in part.</li>
        <li>I understand that, if I am acquiring the Shares in a fiduciary capacity, the representations, warranties, statements,
        covenants, and agreements set forth herein shall be deemed to have been made on behalf of the person or persons
        for whose benefit I am acquiring such Shares. I have properly identified such person or persons in these subscription documents.</li>
        <li>I understand that the Fund may provide the Memorandum, supplements to the Memorandum, reports, distribution
        notices and other information, or documents, electronically unless I opt-out of electronic delivery by sending the
        Fund instructions in writing that I would like to receive such documents in paper format. Unless I elect otherwise
        and notify the Fund as provided herein, all documents will be provided in electronic form by email. I must have
        internet access to use electronic delivery. While the Fund imposes no additional charge for this service, there may
        be potential costs associated with electronic delivery, such as on-line charges. Documents will be available on a
        password-protected web site: www.greenwoodstarinvestments.com</li>
        <li>I may access and print all documents provided through this service. I may opt-out of electronic delivery at any time
        and, following receipt of my notification, the Fund or its agent will begin sending me a paper copy of all required
        documents. However, in order for the Fund to ensure timely delivery of documents to me, my notification must be
        given to the Fund a reasonable time before electronic delivery has commenced. The Fund or its agent will provide
        me with duplicate paper copies at any time upon request. Such request will not constitute notification of my decision
        to opt-out of electronic delivery.</li>
        <li>I understand, acknowledge and agree that if I am participating in the DRIP and I experience a material adverse
        change in my financial condition or can no longer make the certifications, representations or warranties set forth in
        Section 6 or this Section 9, I must promptly notify the Fund in writing, and the Fund and its affiliates may rely on
        such notification to terminate my participation in the DRIP.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The above representations are not a waiver of any rights that I may have under the acts administered by the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission or by any state regulatory agency administering statutes bearing on the offer and sale of securities.</p>
      <p>Indemnification Obligations of the Undersigned</p>
      <p>I hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Fund, the Manager and their respective partners, members,
        officers, directors, affiliates and advisors from any and all damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including
        reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively “Losses”) that they may incur by reason of my failure to fulfill all of the terms and
        conditions of this Subscription Agreement or by reason of the untruth or inaccuracy of any of the representations, warranties,
        statements, covenants or agreements contained herein or in any other documents I have furnished to any of the foregoing in
        connection with my subscription for Shares. This indemnification includes, but is not limited to, any Losses incurred by the
        Fund, the Manager or any of their respective members, officers, directors, affiliates or advisors defending against any alleged
        violation of federal or state securities laws which is based upon, or related to, any untruth or inaccuracy of any of the
        representations, warranties, statements, covenants or agreements set forth herein or in any other documents I have furnished
        to any of the foregoing in connection with my subscription for Shares. The foregoing indemnification obligations shall
        survive until completion of liquidation of the Fund.</p>

      <legend>11. REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISORS*</legend>

      <p>For purposes of the Subscription Agreement and the subscription of the person (the “Subscriber”) subscribing hereunder
        (the “Subscription”), the registered investment advisor identified herein (“RIA”) represents and warrants to, and agrees
        with, the Fund and the Manager as follows:</p>
      <p>1. RIA acknowledges and agrees that no commissions, fees, or other compensation will be paid in respect of the Subscription
        to the RIA by the Fund or any person acting on its behalf.</p>
      <p>2. In its communications with Subscriber with respect to the Offering and in procuring the Subscription, RIA represents as
        follows:
        <br>a. RIA acknowledges the Offering is exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the
        Securities Act. RIA hereby confirms that RIA has taken reasonable steps, as outlined in Rule 506(c)(2)(ii) of
        Regulation D under the Securities Act (including, without limitation, (i) reviewing one or more of the types of
        supporting financial documentation set forth in Rule 506(c)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of the Securities Act, and (ii) obtaining
        appropriate written representations from Subscriber) to verify that the Subscriber is an “accredited investor,” as
        such term is defined by Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, within the previous three months and
        has determined based upon such reasonable steps that Subscriber is an accredited investor.
        <br>b. The Subscriber resides in a jurisdiction that the Fund has identified as a jurisdiction in which the Shares are
        qualified for sale or as to which such qualification is not required.
        <br>c. RIA has determined that an investment in the Fund is appropriate for the Subscriber’s advisory account.
        <br>d. If RIA is not exercising investment discretion with respect to the Subscription, RIA has advised the Subscriber
        that the Subscriber would be afforded the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from the Fund and
        the Manager, and their respective principals, concerning the Fund, the Shares and the terms and conditions of the
        Offering, and to obtain any additional information deemed necessary to verify the accuracy of the information
        contained in the Memorandum to the extent possessed by the Fund or the Manager or obtainable by them without
        unreasonable effort or expense.
        <br>e. RIA has made reasonable inquiry to determine (i) that the Subscriber is acquiring the Shares for the Subscriber’s
        own account and not on behalf of other persons, (ii) that the Subscriber understands the limitations on the
        Subscriber’s disposition of the Shares under applicable federal and state securities laws and the Fund’s governing
        documents, and (iii) that the Subscriber understands that he, she or it must bear the economic risk of the investment
        for an indefinite period of time because of such limitations.
        <br>f. RIA did not provide any information or make any representation concerning the Fund or the Offering except as
        set forth in the Memorandum and any advertising and supplemental sales literature approved by the Manager to be
        used in connection with the Offering.</p>
      <p>3. RIA agrees to maintain, for at least six years, a record of the information obtained to determine that an investment in the
        Shares is a suitable and appropriate investment for the Subscriber and that such Subscriber meets the financial qualification
        and suitability standards and other requirements imposed on investors in the Offering, and to make such records available
        to the Fund and the Manager during such period upon its reasonable request.</p>
      <p>4. RIA agrees to keep records indicating to whom each Memorandum and related materials was delivered and to make such
        information available to the Fund and the Manager upon written request.</p>
      <p>5. RIA represents to the Fund and the Manager that RIA or firm by which RIA is employed (the “Firm”) has established
        and implemented: (a) an anti-money laundering compliance program in accordance with applicable laws and regulations,
        including without limitation federal and state securities laws, the USA Patriot Act of 2001, Executive Order 13224
        Executive Order on Terrorist Financing Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit,
        Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism and industry practices for the investment advisor industry, and (b) a program, in
        accordance with applicable laws and regulations, (i) for the verification of the identity of its new clients, (ii) for maintenance
        of client records, (iii) to check the names of new clients against government watch lists, including the Office of Foreign
        Asset Control’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, and (iv) for the provision of information to the
        Financial Crimes Enforcement Network upon request.</p>
      <p>6. With respect to any nonpublic personal information, as defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Actof1999 (the “GLB Act”),
        of Subscriber provided to RIA, RIA agrees to (a)abide by and comply with and to cause the Firm to abide by and comply
        with (i) the applicable privacy standards and requirements of the GLB Act and the applicable regulations promulgated
        thereunder, (ii) the privacy standards and requirements of any other applicable federal or state law, and the Firm’s
        own internal privacy policies and procedures, each as may be amended from time to time; (b) refrain from the use or
        disclosure of nonpublic personal information (as defined under the GLB Act) of Subscriber if Subscriber has opted out of
        such disclosures, except as necessary to service the Subscriber or as otherwise necessary or required by applicable law; and
        (c) provide Subscriber both initial and annual privacy notices as required pursuant to Rule 6(a) of Regulation S-P,
        promulgated under the GLB Act.</p>
      <p>7. RIA acknowledges that all expenses incurred by RIA in connection with this Subscription Agreement and the Offering,
        including, but not limited to attorneys’ fees, will be RIA’s sole responsibility.</p>
      <p>8. RIA represents that RIA, or the Firm, as applicable, is a duly and properly registered investment advisor in good standing
        under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as amended, and as applicable under the securities laws of the states and the
        jurisdictions where it is required to be registered to conduct its activities.</p>
      <p>9. RIA agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Fund, the Manager, and their respective officers, directors,
        affiliates, agents and representatives (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”), from and against any losses, claims, damages,
        expenses, or liabilities whatsoever, joint or several (“Losses”), to which any of the Indemnified Parties may become subject,
        under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses arise out of or are based upon in whole or in part, any material
        untruth or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or statement made by RIA in this
        Subscription Agreement.</p>
      <p>The undersigned RIA further certifies that his/her signature below constitutes his/her agreement to be bound by all the
        provisions of the terms and conditions set forth in this Section.</p>
